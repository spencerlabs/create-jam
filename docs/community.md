## Contributing

`create-jam` uses GitHub actions to check and pull changes from the respective app templates. Each app (React, Redwood, etc.) has it's own action which calls the core [`create-app` action](https://github.com/spencerlabs/create-jam/blob/next/.github/workflows/create-app.yml).

The best way to test these actions for yourself is to [fork the repo](https://github.com/spencerlabs/create-jam/fork) and make modifications. You could also add your own action for a new framework and test it before [opening a pull request](https://github.com/spencerlabs/create-jam/compare).

## New Frameworks

Head to our [ideas discussions](https://github.com/spencerlabs/create-jam/discussions/categories/ideas) to comment on other people's framework suggestions or, if you don't see one you want, start your own framework discussion.
